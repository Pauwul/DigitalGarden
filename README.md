# DigitalGarden
My [digital garden](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners). Welcome to [my brain]('/brain/Intro.md').

## Abstract
As a developer, I write a lot of documentation. This projects means to document my brain.
It's meant to be a project that centralizes knowledge about the things I take interest in.

## Technical implementation
I use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for local editing. This tool started my journey into these concepts.
For publishing, I'm working with [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz).
